		<h2>Welcome all!</h2>
		    <p>
		    	Welcome dear visitor to this site. This site has been made as a celebration of my favourite childhood show, Batman Beyond! This site is for all lovers of Batman Beyond. I hope you enjoy your visit!
		    </p>

		<h3>Intro:</h3>
		    <p>      
		        Batman Beyond began airing on January 10th, 1999 and lasted three seasons. Airing its finale on December 18, 2001.
		    </p>
			<p> 
				A spin off of Batman the animated series, Batman Beyond focuses on Terry McGinnis, a teenager in 2040, who fights crime as the new Batman for Neo Gotham. Under the stern supervision of an elderly Bruce Wayne, he fights crime in a harsh, futuristic Gotham. The show was created by Paul Dini, Bruce Tim and Alan Burnett. Many cast members from across the DC animated tv line-up return to voice older versions of their beloved characters, such as Kevin Conroy as Bruce Wayne.

				Terry McGinnis is 17 years of age when he becomes the new Batman of Neo Gotham. He takes up the mantle to avenge the death of his father, but continues on as Neo Gothams dark knight as there will always be a need for a Batman in Gotham. Bruce trains Terry and helps him through Terrys earpiece. They make an effective crime fighting team. Terry grew up in rough neighbourhoods, due to Batman not being around for a lot of his youth. This gave Terry adequate street fighting skills e=which he utilised as Batman along with his many gadgets such as batarangs, grappling gun etc.

				Bruce Wayne, the original Batman, has retired. After almost resorting to using a gun, breaking his code, Bruce retires from his role as the dark crusader. He becomes a recluse in Wayne manor as he lets the world go on without him. One day he saves a young Terry McGinnis from a mugging outside Wayne manor, changing his life for the better. Bruce begins to reluctantly train Terry to become the new Batman. Using the Batcomputer and his extensive knowledge of Gotham and its rogues, Bruce helps Terry become the greatest Batman he can be.

				Terry takes on the role of Batman and all that comes with it whether he realises that at first or not. Terry has the luxury of being trained in by his predecessor, yet at times struggles with what it means to be Batman. Terry is not Bruce and finds it difficult at times to see himself as the caped crusader because of it. Yet, he makes the mantle his own, when I was growing up Terry was the Batman I watched, similar to how it must be for the children of Neo Gotham, who never saw Bruce's Batman. Batman becomes more of a myth than a figure and Terry becomes this myth, this symbol of fear for villains and a symbol of hope and justice for the average civilian.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		    	Terry later meets the Justice League of his time, faces the Joker reborn and a host of classic characters. Some take time to accept him as Batman and some accept him immediately. But its important to know that they all accept him in the role. Legacy is taking an inheritance and doing your best with it. Terry takes the mantle of the dark knight and does so much good with it that its difficult to say he isn't Batman.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		    	 Terry isn't Bruce, yet he is vengeance, he is the night, he is... Batman.

				The cast includes: Will Friedle, Terry McGinnis, Kevin Conroy, Lauren Tom, Cree Summer, Ryan O'Donohue, Teri Garr, Stockard Channing, Seth Green, Yvette Lowenthal, Sean Donnellan and Sherman Howard.
